## Troubleshooting

- Sometimes in `Linux` Server when we want particular type of `go version`, and even though after installing that, and when we check for the go version, it shows the previously installed go versions. In that case, it is better to check for go path locations, and delete all other unimportant go versions:

```
# first check the go path with the following command
$ whereis go
# after that remove the go path with the following command
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
```
